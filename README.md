# VS Code Extensions
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
## So what is this?

I have created several extensions for the popular code editor Visiual Studio Code. Particularly, extensions which work on web environments such as github.dev and vscode.dev. I would like to share them all, but I don't have enough pins on my profile page :D. So, I have listed them all here.

## Extensions

### Binary Files

The extensions I am most proud of are for viewing binary files. By far the most annoying error I encounter is this one. It means that nobody has taken time to develop a secure, built-in editor. So, I took it upon myself to make binary file viewers for web users. Below the screenshot are listings of my binary file viewers.

This extension provides commands for unzipping `.zip` files, as well as creating zip files from folders. Also works on renamed zip files such as `.vsix`, `.mcaddon`, etc.
