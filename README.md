# VS Code Extensions
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
## So what is this?

I have created [several extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/AdamRaichu) for the popular code editor Visiual Studio Code. Particularly, extensions which work on web environments such as github.dev and vscode.dev. I would like to share them all, but I don't have enough pins on my profile page. So, I have listed them all here.

## Extensions

### Binary Files

The extensions I am most proud of are for viewing binary files. By far the most annoying error I encounter is this one. It means that nobody has taken time to develop a secure, built-in editor. So, I took it upon myself to make binary file viewers for web users. Below the screenshot are listings of my binary file viewers.

This extension provides an editor for viewing the files inside of zip files, commands for unzipping them, as well as creating zip files from folders. Also works on renamed zip files such as `.jar`, `.vsix`, `.mcaddon`, etc.

#### [PDF Viewer][pdf-viewer]
